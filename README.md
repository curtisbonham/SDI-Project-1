# Blackjack Crypto

Blackjack Crypto is more than just a game website! Sure, it's a place where anyone can come play or practice some hands of blackjack, but you can also monitor the top 5 crypto currencies. You can beat the dealer, then beat the market with up-to-date information!

## Instructions
1. To start the game, press the **START NEW GAME** button.
      * The **NEXT HAND** button will become visible.
      * Press teh **NEXT HAND** button and you will be presented with two cards face up and the dealer will present a card face down and one face up.
2. Next, make a choice if you want to hit or stay based on your score.
      * Remember you are trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, otherwise you **bust** and you **lose**!
3. If you would like another card, press the **HIT** button.
      * Your score will increment and hopefully you have not **BUSTED!!**
4. If or when you like your score, press the **STAY** button.

6. If you want to play again, simply press the **NEXT HAND** button and the game will restart and the dealer will keep track of your wins and losses!
